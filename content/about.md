## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}


I am currently working as a data scientist at iQGateway where we work on a variety of machine learning challenges. I am a knowledge-hungry engineer who is constantly looking for opportunities and real-world challenges to solve, learn and improve my skills. I work on all things machine learning, exploring the domain to find my niche. I love open-source and engange whenever I get the time and chance.
