# My Simple Portfolio

Web resume based on the [hugo-researcher](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher) theme.

Refer the hugo documentation and the theme's repository for more information.

## Embedded PDF of CV

I've modified the [hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode](https://github.com/anvithks/hugo-embed-pdf-shortcode) to embed a pdf of my CV into the page. You can also make it scrollable by modifying the relevant styles.

Refer the original documentation and my modified embed-pdf.html shortcode if you want to adapt the same.

## Previews of writings

Refer the preview.html file for the site previewing used in the writing section. It's not perfect, but, seems to do the job for me.
